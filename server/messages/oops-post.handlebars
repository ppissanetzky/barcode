This one is used to create a new post in the log/activity thread when a user
reports that something is wrong with a frag.
    user - the user object representing the owner of the frag
    frag - all the data from 'mothers' and 'frags' for this item
    notes - the message the user typed in the oops form
}}
no title - this is a post

@{{user.name}} needs help with [URL={{fragUrl frag.fragId}}]{{frag.name}}[/URL].

[QUOTE={{user.name}}]{{notes}}[/QUOTE]

{{!
This one is used to create a post in an existing thread when someone gets in line
for a frag that has frags available
It receives:
    user - the user object representing the user that got in line
    frag - the mother/frag object
    fans - an array of user objects
There is no title
}}
no title - this is a post

I would like a frag of [URL={{fragUrl frag.fragId}}]this one[/URL].

{{#if fans.[1]}}
{{#each fans}}@{{this.name}}, {{/each}}have requested a frag.
{{/if}}
